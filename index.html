      <h3 id = "purpose">Purpose</h3>
      <p id = "a">
	The purpose of this webpage is to start to learn web programming for future use, since I do not have much front-end experience. I never have given much thought to the idea of front-end programming since I always thought I would need an extremely creative/artistic mindset in order to succeed. However, I decided to dive in with this website and have really enjoyed learning the fundamentals of web programming.
      </p>
      <h3 id="aboutMe">About Me</h3>
      <p id="b"> I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I first began trying to code when I was 14 years old. But I had a rough time trying to teach myself with online resources. Even when I was applying to colleges I had a hard time deciding what to major in. I decided to give Computer Science a chance in the hopes that I would thrive in a classroom environment, and I did. Since then, I have been driven in my education and trying to graduate as a major in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.
      </p>
      <h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
      <p id="c">  I have worked on many projects for school in languages such as Python, C, C++, Java, OCaml.
