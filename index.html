          I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I first began trying to code when I was 14 years old. However, I had difficulty learning on my own and my high school did not have the resources to provide programming courses. I had a hard time deciding what to major in, but I decided to try CS in the hopes that I would thrive in a classroom environment that I never had access to before. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px" class = "box-txt">Since then, I've studied Computer Science almost exclusively since Spring Semester of my Sophomore year, beginning my minor around the same time. I've now began to focus on studying databases and learning how industries across the spectrum work with large sets of data available to them to inform business decisions.</p>

          I am currently a Senior at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Computer Science in the College of Science and Engineering with a minor in Statistics. I decided to focus my upper division courses on <b>data-driven computing</b>, which focuses on disciplines such as data science, big data, and GIS.

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
          I have worked with many languages in class so far, gaining experience in relational databases using mySQL, object-oriented programming in Python/Java/C++, to low level programming in C. For my stats minor, I have used Python and R in statistical computing classes to develop statistical models, including time series analysis, multiple linear regression, and using statistical inference to inform real-world decisions.

	         The purpose of this webpage is to better understand the fundamentals of web design. So I decided to design this website with no assistance from front-end frameworks in order to better understand how HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript can come together to bring the user experiences we engage with every day.
